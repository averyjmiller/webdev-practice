            <p>Lana Del Rey is an amazing artist with a wide range of talents such as</p>
            <ul>
                <li>singing and songwriting</li>
                <li>writing poetry</li>
                <li>story telling and world building</li>
                <li>vaping</li>
            </ul>
            <p>With these talents, Lana truly is a generational talent who deserves more recognition
                than what she recieves--like getting snubbed at the 2019 Grammy's for Album of the Year.
                With her most recent album release, "Did You Know That There's A Tunnel Under Ocean Blvd,"
                it is speculated that Lana Del Rey will once again be nominated for the Album of the Year
                award category in 2023. Let's pray to father Elvis and mother Marilyn that Lana will finally
                recieve her first and well-deserved grammy.
